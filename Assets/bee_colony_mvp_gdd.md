# Bee Colony Expansion - MVP Game Design Document

---

## Game Concept

A minimalist idle/clicker game where players control a bee colony expanding across space by building hexagonal tile pathways to reach distant flower sources.

---

## Core Gameplay Loop

1. Player starts with a single Hive tile
2. Hive passively generates Wax (primary currency)
3. Player spends Wax to place Connector tiles adjacent to existing tiles
4. Player builds a path of Connectors to reach pre-placed Flower tiles
5. When connected, Flowers generate Nectar (secondary currency)
6. Goal: Connect to all starting Flowers

---

## Resources

### Wax
- **Generated by:** Hive tile
- **Generation rate:** 1 per second
- **Used for:** Purchasing Connector tiles
- **Starting amount:** 0

### Nectar
- **Generated by:** Connected Flower tiles
- **Generation rate:** 0.5 per second (per flower)
- **Used for:** Nothing in MVP (shows progression)
- **Starting amount:** 0

---

## Tile Types

### Hive (Starting Tile)
- **Quantity:** 1 (placed at start)
- **Function:** Generates Wax passively
- **Cost:** N/A (pre-placed)
- **Visual:** Yellow/Gold color

### Connector (Buildable)
- **Quantity:** Unlimited (player can buy)
- **Function:** Extends pathways, enables connection to Flowers
- **Cost:** 10 Wax
- **Placement rule:** Must be adjacent to existing tile
- **Visual:** Gray/neutral color

### Flower (Destination)
- **Quantity:** 3 (pre-placed at start)
- **Function:** Generates Nectar when connected to Hive
- **Cost:** N/A (pre-placed, cannot be built)
- **Connection requirement:** Continuous path from Hive
- **Visual:** Pink/Purple color

---

## Visual Style

### 2.5D Approach
The game uses 3D assets arranged in a 2D board layout:
- **Tiles:** 3D hexagonal planes laid flat in grid pattern
- **Objects:** 3D models (hive, flowers, bees) placed on tiles
- **Camera:** Angled top-down view (orthographic or slight perspective)
- **Movement:** 3D bees fly between tiles in 3D space

### Tile Presentation (3D)
- Flat hexagonal prisms (minimal height ~0.1 units)
- Different materials/colors per tile type
- Clean, board game aesthetic

### 3D Models

**Hive:**
- Simple cylinder or stylized beehive mesh
- Sits centered on hive tile
- Yellow/gold coloring

**Flowers:**
- Simple 3D flower meshes (petals + stem)
- Sits centered on flower tiles
- Pink/purple coloring
- Optional: Gentle idle sway animation

**Connectors:**
- Minimal 3D hex tile
- Gray/neutral material
- Optional: Pathway texture or subtle bridge visual

**Bees (MVP - Keep Simple):**
- Basic sphere with stripe texture, OR
- Simple low-poly bee mesh
- Flies from Hive to connected Flowers and back
- Movement: Simple lerp/bezier curve along paths
- Scale: Small relative to tiles

### Camera Setup
- Positioned above board at 45-60 degree angle
- Orthographic projection for clean readability
- Static position (no pan/zoom in MVP)
- Frames all starting tiles in view

### Lighting
- Single directional light (sunlight)
- Soft shadows (optional for MVP)
- Bright, cheerful color palette

---

## Game Board

### Layout
- Hexagonal grid system
- Hive placed in center
- 3 Flowers placed at varying distances around Hive
- Infinite empty space for Connector placement

### Example Starting Positions
- **Hive:** Center (0,0)
- **Flower 1:** 3 tiles away (easy reach)
- **Flower 2:** 5 tiles away (medium)
- **Flower 3:** 7 tiles away (requires planning)

---

## Player Actions

### Place Connector Tile
- Click an empty hexagon adjacent to an existing tile
- Costs 10 Wax
- Tile is immediately placed
- Connection check runs automatically

### Wait/Idle
- Wax accumulates passively
- Connected Flowers generate Nectar passively

---

## Win Condition

Player successfully connects pathways from Hive to all 3 Flower tiles.

**Display message:** "Colony Expanded Successfully!"

---

## UI Elements

### Resource Display
- Wax counter (updates in real-time)
- Nectar counter (updates in real-time)

### Visual Feedback
- Valid placement zones highlighted on hover (optional)
- Flowers visually change when connected (color shift, glow, etc.)

---

## MVP Scope - What's Included

✅ Hexagonal tile placement system  
✅ Two currencies (Wax, Nectar)  
✅ Passive resource generation  
✅ Path connection detection  
✅ 3 tile types (Hive, Connector, Flower)  
✅ Simple win state  

---

## MVP Scope - What's NOT Included

❌ Multiple tile varieties  
❌ Upgrades or unlocks  
❌ Prestige/reset mechanics  
❌ Obstacles or terrain  
❌ Fog of war  
❌ Animated bees  
❌ Sound effects or music  
❌ Save/load system  
❌ Multiple levels  
❌ Mobile controls  

---

## Success Metrics for MVP

- Player can place tiles intuitively
- Connection logic works reliably
- Resources increment visibly
- Game is completable in 5-10 minutes
- Core loop is satisfying (even without polish)

---

## Next Steps After MVP

Once MVP is validated:

1. Add 2-3 more flower types with different Nectar values
2. Implement basic upgrades (faster Wax generation, cheaper Connectors)
3. Add visual polish (animations, particle effects)
4. Introduce obstacles that cost more to cross
5. Create save system
6. Design prestige mechanic
